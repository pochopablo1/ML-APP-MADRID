# Data Science and Cybersecurity Bootcamp Project: Madrid Rental Price Prediction

## Challenge Framework

As part of The Bridge Institute's Data Science and Cybersecurity Bootcamp, participants engaged in a unique challenge known as the "Crew Challenge." 
This challenge aimed to foster teamwork, problem-solving abilities, interdisciplinary knowledge, and the application of agile methodologies and product development strategies.

The challenge required students to form interdisciplinary teams. These teams collaborated on real-world projects, pushing the boundaries 
of complexity beyond individual endeavors. The Crew Challenge served as a capstone project, allowing students to integrate their technical 
skills with crucial soft skills, including teamwork, complex problem-solving, and effective communication.

## Project Overview

For our Crew Challenge in the Data Science bootcamp, our team collaborated with the Cybersecurity team to develop an innovative application. 
The goal was to create a tool for predicting rental prices for both short and long stays in Madrid. Leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, 
we aimed to provide users with accurate rental price estimates based on various property and location attributes.

## Project Components and Technologies

The project utilized a Flask web application to deliver the predictive capabilities to users. Key components of the project include:

- **Data Processing and Scaling:** The team implemented data scaling techniques to prepare input features for machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models:** The project incorporated machine learning models, including random forests and clustering algorithms,
  to predict rental prices based on user input.

- **Geospatial Analysis:** The application utilized geospatial data to factor in location-based features and provide more accurate predictions.

- **Web Interface:** Flask was employed to create a user-friendly web interface where users could input property details and receive rental price predictions.

## How to Use the Application

### Short-Term Rentals
- Visit the `/corta_estancia` endpoint.
- Select the district, input property details, and receive short-term rental price predictions.

### Medium-Term Rentals
- Visit the `/media_estancia` endpoint.
- Choose the district, specify property characteristics, and obtain medium-term rental price predictions.

## Results and Impact

The project successfully demonstrated the capabilities of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving real-world challenges. 
Through the Crew Challenge, we not only honed our technical skills but also developed valuable teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills 
essential for professional success.

The application, showcased in the final presentation event, generated accurate rental price predictions for both short and medium-term stays. 
The project's success is a testament to the effectiveness of The Bridge Institute's approach to practical, hands-on learning in the field of data science.
